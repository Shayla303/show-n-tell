##Show-N-Tell##

This page was created with the intent to practice using HTML and CSS to create a static site. The content of the site contains my favorite subject, my 8 year old son Kaleo, and conversely his favorite subject...ANIMALS!
I've omitted using a meta viewport tag for this first iteration of the site. My goal was purely to create the skeleton for a site, I'd like to continue to design and interact with as my skills improve making it responsive and interactive. 
The animals featured on the page are a combination of Kaleo's personal pets, and animals he aspires to care for as a future Veterinarian. 
The future of the site will include making each animal clickable with links to wiki pages about the species. I'd also like to include an audio introduction voiced by Kaleo himself, and a gallery that contains photos of him with his pets, or photos he has chosen to include. 
A basic start, with more to come!
